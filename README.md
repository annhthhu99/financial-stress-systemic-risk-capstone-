# 📊 Financial Stress & Systemic Risk – Capstone Project
Investigating the transmission of financial stress and systemic risk through countries by applying technical tools as PCA, DFM, FAVAR, FEVD, Wavelet, and network analysis)

This capstone project analyzes the transmission of financial stress across six countries using macroeconomic and behavioral indicators.

## 🌐 Countries Analyzed
- United States 🇺🇸
- Germany 🇩🇪
- France 🇫🇷
- Netherlands 🇳🇱
- Poland 🇵🇱
- Czech Republic 🇨🇿

## 🧠 Methods Used
- **PCA** and **Dynamic Factor Models (DFM)** to extract latent stress factors
- **Wavelet Transform (CWT, WTC)** to assess time-varying co-movement
- **Diebold-Yilmaz FEVD** for spillover analysis
- **Network graphs** for systemic transmission visualization

## 📈 Tools & Technologies
- Python: `pandas`, `pywt`, `statsmodels`
- R: `FactoMineR`, `glmnet`, `WaveletComp`
- Tableau, Excel, Git
- Data Sources: FRED, Eurostat, World Bank

## ✅ Key Findings
- Behavioral sentiment indicators exacerbate stress during macroeconomic shocks
- Germany and Poland emerged as central nodes in the stress transmission network

## 📂 Project Structure
- `CODE/`: R and Python codes
- `DATA/`: Raw and processed datasets of research countries
- `Visualizations/`: Generated charts and graphs
- `Capstone Project Final Report.pdf`: Full write-up (methods, results, implications)
